# Readings

This repository is my personal space for learning and experimenting with different programming languages. Here, you'll find various directories with all the textbooks that I am going through. Topics vary but can be broadly categorizied into computer science related readings and programming language readings. 

## Structure
The repository is organized into language-specific directories:
- `/CsTopics` - Contains general computer science topics
- `/ProgLangs` - Contains general programming language topics

## Goals
The primary aim of this repository is to track my progress as I delve into different programming paradigms/computer science topics and enhance my knowledge and skillset
