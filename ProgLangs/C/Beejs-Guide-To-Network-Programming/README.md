## Beejs Guide to Network Programming
[Book Link](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/)

I've seen this book recommended around a lot but have never taken the time to dig into it. I've been going through a computer networking course recently and figured this would be a great opportunity to tackle this book. It is a very short and simple read that is packed with virtually everything you need to get started with network programming. It has a smooth informal flow but gives you the information you need to get up and running with network programming. While I wasn't completely new to networking, I feel like this book did give me a stronger base and provided more modern ways to approach networking. I believe I got a good return on investment with this and it will help me going forward. The knowledge from this book is demonstrated in my [Peer to peer fileserver application](https://github.com/Zacholme7/P2P-File-Sharing). It is quite a crude implementation, but nevertheless I found myself using a lot of the techniques presented in the book and often ended up rewriting my code as I learned about better ways to do things.
