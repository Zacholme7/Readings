Level triggered vs edge triggers
------------------------------
- epoll can notify events in level triggered or edge triggered mode
- default is level triggered, EPOLLET sets edge triggered
- level triggered means that the answer to "has an event happened" is true as long as the electrical signal on an 
interrupt line is high
  - read event has occured as long as there is data in the buffer associated with the file handle
  - can encounter case where we get multiple notis on same events since we havent had time to drain buffer yet
    - EPOLLONESHOT: tells epoll that once we recieve an event on this fd, it should disable fd in the interest list
    - have to reactivate it by calling epoll_ctl with EPOLL_CTL_MOD and new bitmask
- edge triggerd means that the answer to "has an event happened" is true only if the electrical signal has changed from low to high
  - event occurs when buffer goes from having no data to having data
  - wont get repeated notifications but have to drain buffer properly or you dont get any more notifications on that fd
- thundering heard: multiple threads that share a wakeup source in their epoll() sets
