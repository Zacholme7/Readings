// Notes
// -------------
// - use the documentation and type system to make things obvious
// - document any cases where your code may do something unexpected
//  - if code can panic, say so and say what circumstances
//  - if code might return an error, document cases when it does
//  - for unsafe function, state what guarantee has to be made for call to be safe
// - include end-to-end usage examples on crate and module level
// - organize documentation and group together things that are semantically related
// 
// - semantic typing to add types to represent teh meaning of a value, not just its primitive type
//  - for example, booleans. easy to put the booleans in the wrong spot. instead you could use an
//  enum
//
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
