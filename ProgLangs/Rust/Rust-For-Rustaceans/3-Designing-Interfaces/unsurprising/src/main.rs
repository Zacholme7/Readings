// Notes
// -----
// - interface should be intuitive enough that if a user has to guess, they usually guess correctly
// - anything that can be unsurprising should be
// - if you reuse names, user should be able to make basic assumptions from other names
//  - method called iter probably takes &self and gives you an iterator
//  - things that share a name should also work the same way
//
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
