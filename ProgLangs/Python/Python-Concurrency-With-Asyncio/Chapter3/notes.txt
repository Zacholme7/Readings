3.1: Working with blocking sockets
---------------------
- socket is a way to read and write data over a network
- example represents making a simple server

3.2: Connecting to a server with Telnet
---------------------
- can use telnet to try to connect to our server from the previous chapter
- socket class have "recv" that we can use to get data from a socket
    - takes number of bytes that we wish to read
- 3.3 is blocking

3.3: Working with nonblocing sockets
---------------------
- non blocking mode wil make it so that functions will return instantly
- if we dont have data, then an exception will be thrown

3.4: Using the selectors module to build a socket event loop
---------------------
- os has efficient apis that let us watch sockets for cinoming data and other events 
    - give a list of sockets that we want to monitor for events
    - instead of constantly checking each socket to see if it has data, os tells us when sockets have data
    - implemented at the hardware level
- these notifications are at the core of how asyncio achieves concurrency
- selectors api
    - exposes BaseSelector abstract base class
        - multiple implementations for each notifiaction system
    - Default-Selector class, auto chooses which implementation is most efficient
- BaseSelector important concepts
    - registration: register socket with selector and tell it which evnets we are interested in
        - can also deregister a socket when we are no longer interestd
    - select: will block until an event has happened
        - once event happends, call will return with a list of sockets that are read yfor processing along with event that triggered it

3.5: An echo server on the asyncio event loop
---------------------
- working with select is low level and we would rather use asyncio baked in features
- methods for dealing iwth sockets are on asyncios event loop
    - sock_accpet: will return a tuple of a socket connection and a client address
    - sock_recv: will await until a socket has bytes we can process
    - sock_sendall: takies in a socket, the data we want to send and waits until all the data has been sent
- need a coroutine that will just listen for connections
- should create a task for each connection to read and write data
- asyncio can only print the message and traceback for exception in task when the task is garbage collection

3.6: Shutting down gracefully
---------------------
- signals are a concept for asynchronously notifying a process of an event that has occured
- can implement listeners in asyncio that will listen for signals 
    - add_signal_handler method
-
