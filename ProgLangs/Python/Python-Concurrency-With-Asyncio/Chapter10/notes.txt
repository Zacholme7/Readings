10: Microservices
-------------------------
- many web applications are structured as monoliths
- microservice approach can help this

10.1: Why microservices?
-------------------------
- what are they?
    - loosely coupled and independently deployable
    - own independent stack
    - communication with another via a procol (rest, gprc, ...)
    - follow single responsibility, do one thing and do it well
- async can help with concurrent communcation between services

10.2: Introducing the backend for frontend pattern
-------------------------
- instead of UIs directly communcating with our serivces, we create a new service that makes calls and aggregates the response

10.3: Implementing the product listing api
-------------------------
- this section goes though an implementation for an all products page of an ecommerce store
- keeps track of a mapping from user to product ids they have put in their factories list
