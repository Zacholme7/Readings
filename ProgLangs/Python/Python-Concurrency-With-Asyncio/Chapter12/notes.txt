12.1: Asynchronous queue basics
-----------------------------
- queues are first in first out
- asynchronous queues let us use multiple workers to pull from the queue
- why is there nowait at the end of each method?
    - two ways of getting and retrieving an item from a queue
    - one that is a coroutine and blocks
    - one that is nonblocking and is a regular method (get_nowait, put_nowait)
- by default, queues are unbounded
