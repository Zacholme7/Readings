This was a decent book that was a decent return on investment. What initially prompted me to pick it up was some work I was doing in Rust involving asynchronous websockets. There is not much literature available in Rust on the subject, so as an avid Python user I figured I would pick this book up. Most of the value comes from the beginning few chapters. As someone that was new to asynchronous applications, this gave me an understanding of the what and why. It gives a general introduction and slowly builds upon previous chapters. Unfortunately, I personally did not derive much value from the rest of my book. After the first 100ish pages, the book decides to demonstrate topics by various web-based concepts. The examples include things such as building asynchronous web APIs, microservices, etc. I think I could have derived much more value from this book if I would take the knowledge from each chapter and implement something new on my own. I am planning to do this for future readings. This book was a test run of this repository and such. Overall, it was a good read that can make a good reference in the future. It introduced me to various concepts that I did not know of previously and I will be able to draw on in the future
