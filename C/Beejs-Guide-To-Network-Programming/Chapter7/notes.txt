7.1: Blocking
-------------------
- block is a technical jargon for sleep
- you can set a socket to nonblocking with a call to fcntl()
sockfd = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)
fcntl(sockfd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK)

7.2: Polling
-------------------
- poll() allows us to just be notified when some data is ready to be read on the socket
  - process can go to sleep in the meantime
int poll(struct pollfd fds[], nfds_t nfds, int timeout)
  - fds: array of sockets to monitor
  - nfds: count of elements in the array
  - timeout: timeout in ms
struct pollfd {
  int fd;         // the socket descriptor
  short events;   // bitmap of events we're interested in
  short revents;  // when poll() returns, bitmap of events that occured
}
- events is a bitwise OR of the following 
  - POLLIN: alert me when data is ready to recv() on this socket
  - POLLOUT: alert me when I can send() data to this socket without blocking
