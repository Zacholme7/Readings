1: Introduction
------------------------------
- when a set of common behaviors is used with a common language, a protocol is being used
- collection of related protocols is a protocol suit
- the architecture of the protocol suit specifies how various protocols relate to each other and divide up tasks to be accomplished
- TCP/IP is a protocol suit that implements the internet architecture

---------------------------------
| 1.1: Architectural Principals |
---------------------------------
- internet: ability to provide communication between computers
- WWW: application that uses internet for communication
- "Interent architecture should be able to interconnect multiple distinct networks and muliple activites should be able to run simultaneously on the resulting network"

---- Packets, connections, and datagrams ----
- packets switching is an important concept that was developed in the 1960s
  - chunks "packets" are carried though the network
  - can be mixed together (multiplexing)
- when packets recieved at a switch, they are stored in buffer
- scheduled via
1) First in first out
2) Time division multiplexing
3) Statistical multiplexing
- 1960s datagram was developed: packet in which all identifiying info of source and final destination are in the packet

---- The End-To-End Argument and Fate Sharing ----
- end-to-end argument: main rules for taking care of data at endpoints, not in the middle
- design "dumb" network with "smart" systems connected to it
- fate sharing: all state to maintain active communication associate at same location with communicating endpoints (gets there in once piece or it doesnt)

---- Error Control and Flow Control ----
- circumstances where data gets damaged or lost in network, error control deals with it
- various mathematical codes that can fix small errors mid transmission, retransmit with large errors
- cost associated with reliable delivery, most apps just care that they get all the data
- also best effort delivery where network does not put much work into ensuring data is delivered without errors or gaps
- flow control can slow down senders

---- Takeaways ----
- Up to the 1960s, networks were largely based on telephone network which used circuit switching. There was then a shift to packet switching
that broke down the information and sent it over the network via statistical multiplexing and time division multiplexing. Virtual circuits 
preserved the nature of physical circuits but behave like packet switched networks. This is a connection oriented network as each switch has
to maintain some state. Around the 1960s, a datagram was developed which contained all of the necessary information for routing. This lead to 
a connectionless network in contract to VC. The end to end argument and fate sharing is very important in the design of TCP. End to end says
that rules to take care of data should be at endpoint and fate sharing says that either a system all works or none of it works. In terms of data 
transfer, you can get reliable transport for a overhead or best effort delivery where you are not guaranteed to get all your data/correct.

| 1.2: Design and Implementation |
----------------------------------
- implementation architecture defines how the concepts in a protocl architecture may be rendered into existence
- layering is the approach to implementing protocol suits

---- Layering ----
- each layer is responsible for different part of communication
- can evolve each layer separately
- OSI includes 7 layers while TCP is 5
7: application -> specifies methods for accomplishing some user defined task
6: presentation -> methods for epxression data formats and translation rules for applications
5: session -> methods for multiple connections constituting a communication session
4: transport -> methods for connections or associated between multiple programs on one machine
3: network -> methods for communicating between different types of links
2: link -> methods for communicating across single link (DSL, WIFI, ETHERNET)
1: physical -> connections, data rates, bit encoding

---- Multiplexing, Demultiplexing, and Encapsulation in Layered Implementations ----
- protocol multiplexing: allows multiple different protocols to coexist on the same infra and multiple instanciations of same protocol
  - can occur at diff layers and each has diff identifier to determine which protocol/stream belong together
- each layer N encapsulates the packet with identifying information
  - header is used for multiplexing and demultiplexing
- a device does not need to implement all of the layers
- the abstraction via layering is what makes the concept of the internet so powerful

---- Takeaways ----
- Layering is the main architectural approach used to structure the internet. It consists of 7 layers (from highest to lowest): application,
presentation, session, transport, network, link, physical. This allows for a separation of concerns and clean interface between layers. As a
packet is passed up and down the stack, headers/footers are added/taken off. This is identifying information that is used to determine the 
protocol that is being used at that layer. A device does not usually need to implement all of the layers and the specific ones needed depends 
on the use case.

-----------------------------------------------------------
| 1.3: The Architecture and Protocols of the TCP/IP Suite | 
-----------------------------------------------------------

---- The ARPANET Reference Model ----
- TCP/IP adoped the ARPANET reference model
7: application -> any internet compatible application
4: transport -> provides exchange of data between abstract ports
3.5: network (adjunct) -> unofficial layer that helps accomplish setup, management, and security for network layer
3: network -> defines abstract datagrams and provides routing
2.5: link (adjunct) -> unofficial layer used to map addressed used at network to those used at link
- three types of ip addresses: unicast, broadcast, multicast

---- Port Numbers ----
- 16 bit nonnegative integers
- do not refer to anything physical
- used for determining the correct receiving application
- divided into ranges
  - 0-1023 = well known
  - 1024-49151 = registered
  - 49152-65535 = dynamic/private

---- Takeaways ----
- The tcp/ip suit has a slighltly different layering architecture than the OSI model. It is based off the ARPANET model and consists
of the application, transport, network, and link layers. There are various protocols that take place in this layer and this is foundational
to the internet.
