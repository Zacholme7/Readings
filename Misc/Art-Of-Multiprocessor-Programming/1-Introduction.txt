1: Introduction
-------------------------
- transition to building multicore cpus due to moore's law
- multiprocessor chips exploit parallelism
- sequential correctness is concerened with "safety property" (nothing bad will happen) 
  - concurrent programs are also concernered with "liveness property" (something we expect to happen will happen)

1.1: Shared Objects and Synchronization
-------------------------
- "equal ranges of input do not always produce equal amounts of work"
- most hardware provides special read-modify-write instructions to make instrs atomic
- race conditions can be the bane of concurrent programs
  - Ex: two threads access a shared counter at the same time and in the end it only gets incremented once
- mutual exclusion problem: the problem of making sure that ony one thread at a time can execute a particular block of code

1.2: Shared
