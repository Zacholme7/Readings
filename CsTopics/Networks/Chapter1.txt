| 1: Computer Networks and the Internet |
-----------------------------------------

1.1: What is the Internet
-------------------------
- internet: computer network that interconnects billions of computing devices throughout the world
- hosts: devices used to send or receive data packets
- end systems are connected together via communication links and packet switches
- transmittion rate: measured in bits/second
- end system will segment the data and add headers to each segment
    - these are packets
- packet switch recieves a packet and forwards it onto an outgoing link
    - routers (network core) and link layer switches (access network)
- packet switched networks are similar modern transportation networks
- end systems access internet via Internet service provider (ISP)
    - lower tier ISP interconnected through  national and international upper tier ISPs and so forth
- internet runs on protocols (TCP/IP, ...)
- internet is an infrastructure that provides services to applications
- internet applications run on end systems
    - have socket interface that specifies how program on end systesm asks interent to deliver data
- all activity that involves two or more communication entities is governed by a protocol
- protocol: defines the format and the order of messages exchanges between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions
taken on the transmission and/or recepit of a message or other event

1.2: The Network Edge
---------------------
- end systems sit at the edge of the internet
    - also called hosts because they host/run application programs
    - can also be divided into clients and servers
- access network: network that physically connects end system to first router
- Digital subscriber line (DSL) 
    - DSL modem uses existing telephone line
    - send data to digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) in telco local central office
    - modem takes digital data and translates it to high freq tones for transmittion over telephone wire
    - down, up, and telephone split into 3 freq bands
    - splitter at home sparates data and telephone signals
- cable
    - makes use of cable television companys existing cable infra
    - uses cabel modems to connect
    - both a downstream and upstream channel
    - shared broadcase medium, every packet sent by head travvels downstream to every link to every home
    - every packet sent upstream travels to channel head
- fiber to the home
    - optical fiber path from CO directly to home
- in bigger setting, local area network (lan) used to connect end system to edge router
    - ethernet is the most common
    - also wireless LAN is very popular
- bit is propogated across a physical medium
    - guided media and unguided media
- guided media: waves guided along a solid medium
    - (fiber optic, twiser pair copper, coaxial
- unguided media: waves propogated in atmosphere and outer space
    - wireless lan or digial satalite channel
- cost of physical link is often minimal
- twisted pair copper wire
    - least expensive and more commly used 
    - wire pair is a single communication link
    - 10mpbs to 10gbps
    - data rates depends on thickness of wire and distance
- coaxial cable
    - two concentric copper conductions that is insulated and shielded
    - common in cable television systems
    - can be used as guided shared medium
- fiber optics
    - thin flexible medium that conducts pulses of light
    - exch pulse represents a bit
    - tens to hundreds of gigabits per second
    - good for long haul guided transmission medium
- terrestrial radio channels
    - carry signals in electromagnetic spectrum
    - no physical wire needed
    - characteristics depend on environment and distance
    - three groups: short distance, local areas, wire area
- satellite radio channel
    - links two or more earth based microwave trasmitter/receivers (ground stations)
    - receives tramissions and regenerates signal using repeater
    - geostationary satellites: permanently remain above same spot on Earth
    - low earth orbiting satellites: do not remain stationary and rorate

1.3: The Network Core
---------------------
- end systems exchange messages with each other
- end systems breaks long messages into smaller chunks known as packets
- packets travel through comm links and packet switches
    - transferred at rate equal to rate of link
- store and forward transmission: packet swtich must recieve full packet before it can start to forward it
    - delay = N * (L/R)
        L: bits
        R: Bits/sec
        N: number of links
- each packet switch has multiple links attatched to it
    - each link as a output buffer that stores packets that the router is about to send into that link
    - leads to queuing delays
    - packet loss if queue is full
