1: Introducing the data platform
------------------
- every busniess requires analytics
- late 1980s created concept of data warehouse
    - centralized repository of structured data combined from multiple sources
- cloud data platform: a cloud native platform capable of cost effectively ingesting, integrating, transforming
and managing an almost unlimited amount of data of any type in order to facililtate analytics outcomes
- three v's: data variety, volume, and velocity

1.1: The trends behind the change from data warehouses to data platforms
------------------
- SaaS has resulted in the increase in the variety and number of sources of data being collected
    - also semistructured and unstructured data
- another change from architecture from monolithic to microservices

1.2: Data warehouses struggle with data variety, volume, and velocity
------------------
- relational warehouse typically has an ETL(extract, transform, load) tool or process that delivers dta into tables in the data warehouse on a schedule
    - also has storage, compute, and SQL services running on single physical machine
- traditional warehouses designed to work exclusively with structured data
    - they are not flexible
    - hav eto process data in warehouses built in SQL engine or specific sotred procedure language
- traditional warehouse storage and processing are coupled together which limits scalability and flexibility
    - limited by budget
- traditional warehouse is batch oriented: take nighly data, load it into a staging area, apply logic, load fact and dimension tables
    - data delayed until these processes are finished

1.3: Data lakes to the rescue
------------------
- data lake: a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native format until it is needed
    - unintegrated, non subject oriented collection of data
- cloud addresses all of the issues 

1.4: Along came the cloud
------------------
- data warehouses and data lakes have moved to the cloud
- brought multiple things
    - elastic resources: can get storage and compute from favorite cloud vendor and adjust amount
    - modularity: storage and computer are seperate in cloud world
    - pay per use: only pay for what you use
    - operational expense
    - managed services are the norm: cloud provider does a lot of functions
    - instant availability: order and deploy take minutes
    - cloud only processing frameworks
    - faster feature introduction
