- purpose is to send/receive ip datagrams
- support ethernet, dsl, wifi

---- 3.2: Ethernet and the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards ----
----------------------------------------------------------
- first common form of ethernet adoped in IEEE standard 802.3
- stations on shared ethernet segment
- carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD): mediate which system can access shared medium
  - (carrier sense) look if someone sender, only send when line is free
  - if collision detected, each machine wait random time before sending again
- Access methods more formally called media access control (MAC) protocols
- nowadays, typically dedicated ethernet lines from a central ethernet switch

---- 3.2.1: The IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standard ----
--------------------------------------
- 802 prefix deinfe operations of LANs and MANs
- ethernet introduced in 802.3
- wireless introducted in 802.11
- locigal link control (LLC) frame header in 802.2

---- 3.2.2: The Ethernet Frame Format ----
-----------------------------------
- ethernet is an asynchronous LAN, space between encoded bits may differ from one interface card to the next
- begins with preamble (7 bytes) area used by the receiving interfaces circuity to determine when a frame is arriving
and to determine the amount of time between encoded bits (clock recovery)
  - recognizable pattern (10101010 (0xAA) repeated 7 times) which receiver can use to "recover the clock" by the time the start frame delimited (SFD = 0xAB) is found
- 48 bit (6 byte) Destination (DST) and Source (SRC) address fields, also known as MAC address/Link layer address/physical address/hardware address
  - DST can also address more than one station (broadcast/multicast)
- Type/length field (2 bytes). Ipv4 (0x0800), Ipv6(0x86DD), ARP (0x0806), value >= 1536 indicate type, value <= 1500 indicate length
- Tags: contain various protocol fields defined by other IEEE standards
- Payload data: 48-1500 bytes, where higher layer PDUs are placed
- Frame check sequence: 4 bytes at end of frame, used for error/corruption detection, generated using cyclic redundancy check algorithm
- minimum ethernet frame size is 64 bytes, need payload length of minimum 48 bytes
  - padded with zeros if payload length not achieved
- Interpacket gap: 12 byte times, ensure proper data recovery and provides opporunity for other traffic


---- Memory Notes ----
----------------------
- carrier sense, multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD): mediate which system can access shared medium, look if someone is sending
and only send when line is free, if collision detected wait random time and send again. 
- ethernet preamble: 7 bytes used by receiving intrface to determine when a frame is ariving, 0xAA repeated 7 times used to recover the clock by time start
frame delimiter arrives (SFD = 0xAB)
- destination MAC address: 6 bytes, destination address, can address more that one station (broadcast/multicast)
- source MAC address: 6 bytes, source address
- type field: 2 bytes, can also be length field, typically identifies type of data that follows the header, Ipv4 (0x0800), Ipv6(0x86DD), ARP (0x0806),
value >= 1536 indicate type, value <= 1500 indicate length
- payload data: 48-1500 bytes where higher layer pdus are placed
- Frame check sequence: 4 bytes at end of frame, used for error/corruption detection, generated using cyclic redundancy check algorithm
- Components of an ethernet frame: preamble, start frame delimiter, desitnation mac, source mac, type/length, payload, frame check sequence
- Interpacket gap (IPG) : 12 byte times, ensure proper data recovery and provides opporunity for other traffic
