| 2: The Internet Address Architecture |
------------------------------------------
---- 2.1: Introduction ----
- network layer addresses use IP addressing
- every device connected to internet has IP address
- often shielded from user by DNS


---- 2.2: Expressing Ip Addresses ---- 
- IPv4 is most popular ip type
  - expressed in dotted decimal notation
  - ex: 165.195.130.107
  - 4 numbers in range [0, 255]
  - dotted decimal notation just a way to express 32 bit nonegative representation
  - 165.195.130.107 -> 10100101 11000011 10000010 01101011
- Ipv6 is 128 bits in length
  - four hexadecimal numbers called block/fields separated by colons
  - Ex: 5f05:2000:80ad:5800:0058:0800:2023:1d71
- standardized simplifications
1) leading zeroes do not need to be expressed
  - Ex: 5f05:2000:80ad:5800:58:800:2023:1d71
2) Blocks of all zeroes can be obmitted and replaced by ::.
  - Ex: 2001:0db8:0:0:0:0:0:2 -> 2001:db8::2
3) Ipvj represented in Ipv6 form can use notation where block preceeding ipv4 portion has value FFFF
  - Ex: ::ffff:10.0.0.1 represents ipv4 10.0.0.1
  - called IPv4 mapped IPv6 address
4) low order 32 bits of ipv6 address can be written using dotted quand notiation
  - Ex: ipv6 addr ::0102:f001 -> ::1.2.240.1
  - called ipv4 compatible ipv6 address
  - this is no longer required

---- 2.3: Basic IP Address Structure ----
- ipv4 has 4,294,967,269 possible combinations
- ipv6 has 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possible combinations
- convenient to devide address space into chunks
- most ipv4 addresses sundivided down to single address used to identify single network interface of computer attached to interent
  - called unicast addresses 
- historical evolution of ip addresses

----- classful addressing -----
- when internet address originally defined, every unicast ip address has network portion
  - identified network on which the interface using the ip address was to be found
- also had host portion
  - identified particular host on network given in the network portion
- ip contained a net number and a host number
- networks began to have different number of hosts and each host needed a ip addresses
- developed paritioning where different size allocation units of ip addr space given out to sites based on projected number of hosts
- divided into 5 classes
A) 0: net number: 8 bits; 7 free (0 = A), host: 24 bits, mask 255.0.0.0, very large netowrks
- address range (0.0.0.0–127.255.255.255), unicast, 1/2 fraction of total, num nets = 128, num hosts = 16,7772216
B) 10: net number: 16 bits; 14 free (10 = B), host: 16 bits, mask 255.255.0.0, medium sized networks
- address range (128.0.0.0–191.255.255.255), unicast, 1/4 fraction of total, num nets = 16,384 num hosts = 65,536
C) 110: net number: 24 bits; 21 free (110 = C), host: 8 bits, mask 255.255.255.0, small networks
- address range (192.0.0.0–223.255.255.255), unicast, 1/8 fraction of total, num nets = 2,097,152 num hosts = 256
D) 1110: multicast address: 32 bits; 28 free (1110 = D)
- address range (224.0.0.0–239.255.255.255), multicast, 1/16
E) 1111: reversed: 32bits; 28 free (1111 = E)
- address range (240.0.0.0–255.255.255.255), reserved, 1/16
- this scheme was used till about the early 1980s unitl it began to have scaling problems

----- Subnet Addressing -----
- inconvenience to have to allocate new network number for any new network segment attatched to the internet
- alter network portion of ip address for local purpose at site, rest of network would see A,B,C paritions
  - subnet addressing
- site allocated as A, B, or C leaving some host bits to further allocated and assigned within site
- divide host potion of its base address allocation into subnet number and a host number
- administrator is free to change subnet number and host number allocation as they saw fit
  - allows for an easily configurable network:host ratio

----- Subnet Masks -----
- subnet mask: assignment of bits used by host or router to determine how the network and subnetwork info
is partitioned from the host info in a corresponding ip address
- configured statically or dynamically
- used to determine where the network/subnetwork portion of ip address ends and host part begins
- 1 in subnet masks = corresponding bit position in IP address should be considered part of combined network/subnetwork portion of address
- 0 in subnet maks means corresponding bit position should be considered part of the host portion
- subnet maks is purely a local matter at the site

----- Variable Length Subnet Masks (VLSM) -----
- it is possible to use a different length subnet mask applied to the same network numbers in different portions of the same site
- adds flexibility since diff subnetworks can be set up with different number of ports
- VLSM now supported by most hosts, routers, and routing protocols 

----- Broadcast Addresses -----
- in ipv4 subnetwork, special address is the subnet broadcast address
- formed buy setting network/subnetwork portion of ipv4 address to right value and then all bits in the host field to 1
  - invert subnet mask and perform OR with address of any computer on subnet

----- IPv6 addresses and Interface Identifiers -----
- ipv6 addrs are 4 times longer than ipv6
- special prefixes indicate scope of address, indicate portion of network where address can be used 
  - node-local: address only valid for communication within the same device
  - link-local: address is valid for communication among devices on the same network segment or ipv6 prefix
  - global: address is valid across the internet
- ipv6 devices typically use more than one address for communication
- interface identifiers are used to uniquely identify interfaces on a netowrk
  - can be formed from mac address of nic using EUI-64 format
- EUI-64 invovles 24 bit OUI and 40 bit extension

---- 2.4: CIDR and Aggregation ----
- in early 1990s there was serious scaling problem
1) by 1994 onver half of all class B addresses allocated
2) 32bit ipv4 inadequate size
3) entries in global routine table was growing fast
- Introduction of classless inter domain routing
  - address range is not predefined as being part of a class, instead requires a mask
  - called network prefix
- eliminate predefined separation of network and host number within ip address, makes finer grain allocation possible
- prefix appended to end of ip address following /

---- 2.5 Special-Use Addresses ----
- consult book for list of special addresses
- may want to translate betwee ipv4 and ipv
  - makes use of ipv4 embeded ipv6 address
  - contains ipv4 address within ipv6 address
- ipv4/6 both support multicast address which identifies a group of host interfaces rather than just one
- for ipv4, class D space reserved for multicast
