3.1: Exploring a Virtual Machine
------------------------------
- vm runs on a physical machine
    - isolated from each other from a hypervisor
- consists of cpus, memory, network interfaces, and storage
- physical machine is called the host machine
    - vms running on it are called guests
- hypervisor is responsible for isolating guests from each other and schedules requests to the hardware
- the AMI is the basis for your virtual machine starts
    - when choosing, think about requirements of the application that you want to run on the VM
- aws classifies computing power into instance types
    - T family: cheaper, moderate performance with ability to burst for short periods
- M family: General purpose with balance of CPU and memory
- C family: computer optimized, high CPU performance
- R family: memory optimized
- X family: extensive capacity with a focus on memory
- D family: storage optimized, offer huge HDD capacity
- I family: storage optimized, offer huge SSD capacity
- P, G, CG family: accelerated computing based on GPUs
- F family: accelerated computing based on FPGAs
