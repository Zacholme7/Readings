- only pass to touch every character in input program

2.1: Introduction
-----------------
- also called lexical analyzer or lexer
- reads stream of characters and produces stream of words
- aggregates characters into words and then determines if the word is valid in the src language
  - each valid word assigned syntactic category
- compiler must understand lexical structure (spelling) and syntactic structure (grammar)
- specify lexical structure of input language using set of regular expressions
- produces pair <lexeme, category>, pair called a token
  - lexeme: actual text for a word recognized by the scanner
  - category: the syntactic category
- microsyntax: the lexical structure of a language
- start from specification of languages microsyntax
