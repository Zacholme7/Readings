1: What is amazon web services
------------------------
- cloud computing is a metaphore for supply and consumption of IT resources
    - layers of abstraction exist between the user and the IT resources
    - offers things like virtual machines, providing software as a service, on demand resources, etc..
- 5 essential characteristics: on demand self service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, measured service
- offerings are divided into three types
    - public: cloud managed by an organization and open to use by the general public (AWS)
    - private: cloud that virtualizes and distributes the IT infra for a single organization
    - hybrid: a mixture of public and private cloud

- management console allows you to manage and access services though a GUI
- can use command line interface to also access it
- can use a sdk to interact with many programming languages
- blueprint: a description of your system containin all resources and their dependencies
    - infrastructure as code tool compares your blueprint with the current system and calcualtes the steps to update infra
