| 4: File Systems | 
-------------------
- computer systems need to store and retrieve information
- requirements for long term info storage
1) Must be possible to store very large amount of info
2) Information must survive the termination of the process using it
3) Multiple processes must be able to access info at once
- File: logical units of information created by processes
  - info in files is persistent
  - managed by OS

| 4.1: Files
---------------------------

---- File Naming ----
---------------------------
- a file is an abstraction mechanism to store and load info
- file name and file extension (indicates something about the file)

---- File Structure ----
-----------------------------
- file can be structured as byte sequence, record sequence, or as a tree
- byte sequence
        - unstructured
        - os does not know or care what is in the file, just sees the butes
        - used by unix and windows
        - provides a lot of flexibility
- record sequence      
        - sequence of fixed length records
        - read operations return one record and write operations overwrite/append one record
- tree based
        - file consists of tree of records, each contain key field in fixed position on the record
        - get the record with a specific key
