| 4: File Systems | 
-------------------
- computer systems need to store and retrieve information
- requirements for long term info storage
1) Must be possible to store very large amount of info
2) Information must survive the termination of the process using it
3) Multiple processes must be able to access info at once
- File: logical units of information created by processes
  - info in files is persistent
  - managed by OS

| 4.1: Files |

---- File Naming ----
---------------------
- a file is an abstraction mechanism to store and load info
- file name and file extension (indicates something about the file)

---- File Structure ----
------------------------
- file can be structured as byte sequence, record sequence, or as a tree
- byte sequence
  - unstructured
  - os does not know or care what is in the file, just sees the butes
  - used by unix and windows
  - provides a lot of flexibility
- record sequence      
  - sequence of fixed length records
  - read operations return one record and write operations overwrite/append one record
- tree based
  - file consists of tree of records, each contain key field in fixed position on the record
  - get the record with a specific key

---- File Types ----
--------------------
- regular files: contain user information
  - ascii/binary files
  - can easily edit
- directories: system files for maintaining structure of file system
- character special files: related to input/output
- block special files: used to model disks

---- File Access ----
---------------------
- random access files
- read operation can give position where to start reading
- seek can be used to set the current position
- can then read sequentially

---- File Attributes ----
-------------------------
- metadata describing properties of the file
  - protection, creator, time stats, ...

---- File Operations ----
- create, delete, open, close, read, write, append, seek, get attrs
set attrs, rename

---- Summary ----
- Files are a key primitive in operating systems. They are an abstraction over sequence of bytes
that provide convinent access without exposing the underlying hardware. There are various types of file
that you can create and each file has a bunch of attributes/metadata associated with it to describe important 
information about the file

--- Memory Notes ----
---------------------
- None
